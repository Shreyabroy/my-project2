<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A flood is an overflow of an expanse of water that submerges land.River and coastal flooding are the most frequently occurring natural disaster and are increasing in occurrence more rapidly than any other disaster. Urbanization and deforestation reduce the capability of the earth to hold excess water.Those areas which are most at risk for floods include low-lying areas, coastal regions, and communities on rivers downstream from dams. Flood waters are extremely dangerous; a mere six inches of swiftly moving water can knock people off their feet. Dam breaks are also a cause of catastrophic flooding.</p>

<h1>Types of Flood</h1>
<p>It is a temporary inundation of large regions as a result of an increase in reservoir, or of rivers flooding their banks because of heavy rains, high winds, cyclones storm surge along coast, tsunami, melting snow or dam bursts.</p>

<h2>Flash Floods</h2>
<p>It is defined as floods which occurs within six hours of the beginning of heavy rainfall, and are usually associated with cloud bursts, storms and cyclones requiring rapid localized warning and immediate response if damage is to be mitigated. In case of flash floods, warning for timely evacuation may not always be possible.</p>

<h2>River Floods</h2>
<p>Such floods are caused by precipitation over large catchmentâ€™s areas. These floods normally build up slowly or seasonally and may continue for days or weeks as compared to flash floods.</p>

<h2>Coastal Floods</h2>
<p>Some floods are associated with the cyclonic activities like Hurricanes, tropical cyclone etc. Catastrophic flooding is often aggravated by wind-induced strom surges along the coast.</p>

<p><u>From our end it is our duty to know and follow the steps of flood preparedness to be safe and make others safe too...</u></p>
